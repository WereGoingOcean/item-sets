# item-sets 
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/WereGoingOcean/item-sets/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

Similar function to championify. Makes item sets for league and imports them.

Originally I wanted to try and update chamionify. But the npm packages are way outdated. I don't really understand all the build set up. And didn't want to take all the time trying to update the packages.
